# resin_supports_for_fdm_pipeline

Drop in any STL → it gets auto-oriented for printing and fitted with **resin-style
supports dimensioned for FDM** (thin pillars, tiny snap-off contact tips, diagonal
cross-braces), then exported ready to slice. Runs as a local web app in the browser.

Full design: [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).

## Git rules — READ THIS BEFORE ANY GIT COMMAND

Remote: <https://github.com/FireB1scuit/resin_supports_for_fdm_pipeline>

1. **NEVER push to `main`.** Not `git push origin main`, not a force push, not a
   fast-forward, not "just this once". There is no situation in this project where
   pushing to `main` is correct.
2. **`main` only ever changes by merge.** Work lands on `main` through a pull request
   that gets merged. Nothing else touches it.
3. **All work happens on a branch.** Branch off `main`, name it
   `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, or `chore/…`.
4. **Push regularly.** Commit and push the working branch often — at minimum at the end
   of any response that changed code. No need to ask for confirmation to commit or push
   a *working branch*. Small, frequent commits over one big one.
5. Never use `--no-verify`, and never bypass signing.

Normal loop:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-thing && git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push -u origin feat/my-thing
```

If a push to `main` is ever attempted, stop and open a PR instead.

## Project rules

- **Python 3.14**, on Windows. `numpy`, `scipy`, `trimesh`, `shapely`, `fastapi`,
  `uvicorn`. Do **not** add `embreex` or `manifold3d` — 3.14 wheels are unreliable and
  neither is needed (see PLAN.md: rays are all straight down; supports are concatenated,
  not boolean-unioned).
- **No Node.js.** The frontend is plain ES modules with a vendored `three.module.js`.
  Never introduce a build step, a bundler, or a `package.json`.
- **All support dimensions derive from `nozzle_diameter`** in `presets.py`. Never hardcode
  a millimetre value in geometry code.
- **The self-printability invariant is non-negotiable**: generated support geometry must
  never contain an overhang steeper than the printable limit. If our supports would need
  supports, the generator is broken. `tests/test_supports.py` enforces this.
- Geometry stages stay separate: `orient` → `points` → `geometry`. The UI edits the point
  list between stages, so stage 3 must be cheap to re-run alone.
- Run `pytest` before pushing.
